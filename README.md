# ESSMT
> Erindale's SS Math Tournament.

## Information
ESSMT was held on February 19, 2020. With over 50 attendees competing for over $2200 in prizes, 
the event was a success despite setbacks due to the Teacher Union strikes which forced the team to 
downsize the competition from board-level to school-level. Special thanks to our sponsors DigitalOcean 
and .TECH Domains for making it happen as well as individual and grassroots contributions we've gotten!
